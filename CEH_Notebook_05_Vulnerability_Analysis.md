Vulnerability Analysis
----------------------

Vulnerability assessments scan networks for known security weaknesses: it recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, and communication channel; and evaluates the target systems for vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, and weak encryption. Additionally, it assists security professionals in securing the network by determining security loopholes or vulnerabilities in the current security mechanism before attackers can exploit them.

The information gleaned from a vulnerability assessment helps you to identify weaknesses that could be exploited and predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in protecting information resources from attack.


A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system. It is frequently a security loophole that enables an attacker to enter the system by bypassing user authentication. There are generally two main causes for vulnerable systems in a network, software or hardware misconfiguration and poor programming practices. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various types of attacks on organizational resources.



## Perform Vulnerability Research with Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases

### Perform Vulnerability Research in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It has numerous categories of weaknesses that means that CWE can be effectively employed by the community as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. Further, CWE has an advanced search technique with which you can search and view the weaknesses based on research concepts, development concepts, and architectural concepts.

### Perform Vulnerability Research in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

https://cve.mitre.org/ => moved to https://www.cve.org/

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. It is used to discuss or share information about a unique software or firmware vulnerability, provides a baseline for tool evaluation, and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation.


### Perform Vulnerability Research in National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

https://nvd.nist.gov/

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). These data enable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.




## Perform Vulnerability Assessment using Various Vulnerability Assessment Tools

### Perform Vulnerability Analysis using OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any vulnerability test. The actual security scanner is accompanied with a regularly updated feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)—over 50,000 in total.


### Perform Vulnerability Scanning using Nessus

Nessus is an assessment solution for identifying vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and malware, which can be used to penetrate networks. It performs vulnerability, configuration, and compliance assessment. It supports various technologies such as OSes, network devices, hypervisors, databases, tablets/phones, web servers, and critical infrastructure.


### Perform Vulnerability Scanning using GFI LanGuard

GFI LanGuard scans, detects, assesses, and rectifies security vulnerabilities in your network and connected devices. It scans the network and ports to detect, assess, and correct security vulnerabilities, with minimal administrative effort. It scans your OSes, virtual environments, and installed applications through vulnerability check databases. It enables you to analyze the state of your network security, identify risks, and address how to take action before it is compromised.


### Perform Web Servers and Applications Vulnerability Scanning using CGI Scanner Nikto

	nikto -H	# Help
	
	
A tuning scan can be used to decrease the number of tests performed against a target. By specifying the type of test to include or exclude, faster and focused testing can be completed. This is useful in situations where the presence of certain file types such as XSS or simply “interesting” files is undesired. 

Starts scanning with all the tuning options enabled:

	nikto -h (Target Website) -Tuning x
Note: -h: specifies the target host and x: specifies the Reverse Tuning Options (i.e., include all except specified).
Note: The scan takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.


Check for cgi directories with the -Cgidirs option. In this option, search for specific directories or use all options to search for all the available directories:

	nikto -h (Target Website) -Cgidirs all
Note: -Cgidirs: scans the specified CGI directories; users can use filters such as “none” or “all” to scan all CGI directories or none).
Note: The scan takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.


To output the scan result to a txt file:

	nikto -h (Target Website) -o (File_Name) -F txt
